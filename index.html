        I wish to be a programmer of some kind. I made a game in Batch code called Gunner when I was eleven.
        <br>
        I am 18 and I wanted to code since I learned you can make it a career and has been a passion of my to program and test the computer.
        <br>
        Besides programming, I love to play guitar and I play games like every teenage male in this world that can afford a home entertainment console.

        Favorite band is Hollywood Undead. Here is a link to my Spotify playlist to show how sad and depressing I really am.
